    Description: This program is used by the Microage Executive Support
    technicians to track the work they perform. The program is linked to a
    database that holds the client data and their computer information. This
    information is automatically updated when a ticket is submitted. The program
    generates an .xml file that is used by Clearview to import the data into its
    system. The program has a feature to send an email copy of the excel file
    but this feature was disabled to comply with the new Ontario Anti Span
    legislation.
    How to Run:
    You must have an I: drive and a W: drive mapped to create the log files.
    Browse to the Dist folder and run Rogers_New_Ticket.jar.
    Alternately the project can be loaded directly into Netbeans IDE 7.3.1
